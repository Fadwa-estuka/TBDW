<BR><EM>Hello everyone. Has anybody of you tried to insert in WebSearch the feature &quot;Posted within the last XX [days, weeks, etc.]&quot; ? This is available in the WebBBS/Forum Search, but not in WebSearch (I can imagine why. But it would be nice to have it also in WebSearch, nevertheless...).

<BR><EM>Bad news first. In view of the effort put into Forum Main Index Addon and of the fact that the addon can be used for future releases of WebBBS, i've decided to make it a &quot;barterware,&quot; meaning that those who want a copy of it, must send me something in return. That something can be anything *they* want to send me. It can be $$, graphics made at my request, a new/viewed DVD, used computer parts, left over from garage/yard sale, even a chocolate bar, etc. The idea mainly is not to make $$</EM>
